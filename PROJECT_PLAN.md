# MemeStack: Meme Management & Design Platform

## Project Overview
A comprehensive web-based platform for meme creators to design, manage, organize, and share memes with advanced features for content creation and community interaction.

## Technology Stack (MERN)
- **Frontend**: React.js with modern hooks and functional components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (following MVC architecture)
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary or local storage for meme images
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern techniques and possibly Tailwind CSS

## Learning Path for You
Since you know HTML5, CSS, and basic JavaScript, we'll progressively teach you:

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Backend Setup
- Node.js basics and npm
- Express.js framework and MVC architecture
- MongoDB setup and basic CRUD operations
- RESTful API design principles

### Sprint 2: Advanced Backend & Frontend Setup
- JWT authentication implementation
- React.js fundamentals and component-based architecture
- State management with React hooks
- API integration with frontend

### Sprint 3: Advanced Features
- File uploads and image processing
- Advanced React patterns
- Database relationships and aggregations
- UI/UX improvements

### Sprint 4: Testing & Deployment
- Testing strategies
- Error handling and validation
- Performance optimization
- Deployment preparation

## MVC Architecture Implementation
```
Backend Structure:
├── controllers/     # Handle HTTP requests and responses
├── models/         # Database schemas and business logic
├── views/          # API responses (JSON in our case)
├── routes/         # URL routing and middleware
├── middleware/     # Authentication, validation, etc.
└── config/         # Database and environment configuration

Frontend Structure:
├── components/     # Reusable UI components (View layer)
├── pages/         # Main page components
├── services/      # API calls and business logic
├── context/       # State management
└── utils/         # Helper functions
```

## Incremental Development Approach
Each sprint will build upon the previous one, with working features delivered at the end of each sprint.
