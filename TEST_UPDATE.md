# Test Update - August 5, 2025

This is a test update to verify that the project folder is properly connected to the GitHub repository.

## Status
- âœ… Project successfully cloned and running
- âœ… Backend server operational with in-memory database
- âœ… Frontend React app running on localhost:3000
- âœ… All dependencies installed and configured
- âœ… Git repository connection verified

## Test Performed
- Cloned fresh copy of repository to resolve previous errors
- Confirmed project functionality
- Testing Git push capability

## Code Refactoring - Reusable Components âœ¨

### ðŸ”„ **Code Reusability Improvements:**
- **Created `StatCard` component**: Replaces duplicate stat cards across Dashboard, Analytics, and Moderation pages
- **Created `ActionCard` component**: Reusable component for action buttons with icons and descriptions
- **Eliminated code duplication**: Removed ~200+ lines of duplicate code across multiple files

### ðŸ“Š **Components Refactored:**
1. **Dashboard.js**: Now uses StatCard for stats, ActionCard for actions
2. **AnalyticsDashboard.js**: Replaced internal MetricCard with reusable StatCard
3. **ModerationDashboard.js**: Converted stat cards to use StatCard component

### ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits Achieved:**
- **Consistency**: All stat cards now have uniform styling and behavior
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for stat card logic
- **Flexibility**: Multiple variants (compact, default, detailed) for different use cases
- **Hover effects**: Consistent interactions across all cards
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features to all cards at once
